## I. Overview of Project

### Background
Using bike sharing data from NYC, we need to submit a proposal to an investor how this business would work in Des Moines, Iowa. 

### Objective
To solidify the proposal, we need to show a bike trip analysis with visualizations that:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
